    "# Retroactive DCF Calculation\n",
    "Using actual cash flow data, rather than predicted cash flow based on growth assumptions, this notebook retroactively computes a DCF valuation for a company at the time a deal was proposed. By comparing this valuation to the terms of the proposed acquisition deal, one can determine whether the terms of the deal proved advantageous for the target or acquirer independent of overall market performance. This comarison can be used to label the acqusition dataset. "
